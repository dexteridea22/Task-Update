## Analysis
I carefully analysed for following solutions:
1. Using Ajax call
2. Web sockets

## Design Assumptions
For this solution since the updates are server side push events and updates are only for single column
I thought of choosing ajax calls , here I assumed the users(client) to be fewer.  
In case users increase and updates are also multiple from both server and client side(Publish Subscribe mechanism)
I think using web sockets is better in that case.

## Technology :
- Backend : Django,DRF
- Database : sqlite

## Test driven development:
- created test cases to test CRUD Operations
in DRF apis
- Tested from rest apis 

## Output file:
Log file to log json data after status is completed
